# DISHARI – Women's Safety Monitoring System

🚨 **Project by Team SAFESPHERE**

## 🔒 Problem Statement

DISHARI addresses women's safety in public spaces using intelligent CCTV-based monitoring. When a woman feels unsafe, she can signal for help using a specific hand gesture. The system detects this SOS gesture and analyzes real-time data such as men-women ratio and suspicious male behavior to generate alerts and notify nearby authorities.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Gesture-Based SOS Detection**  
  Detects a predefined “I want help” gesture from women using CCTV footage.

- **Behavior Analysis**  
  Identifies inappropriate hand or facial gestures from men that indicate harassment or unsafe behavior.

- **Gender Ratio Monitoring**  
  Continuously tracks the male-to-female ratio in a public area; raises alerts if the ratio drops below a safety threshold.

- **Incident Heatmap**  
  Highlights areas with a history of repeated incidents as high-alert zones to warn users and authorities.

2. **Offensive Gesture Dataset (Male)**
